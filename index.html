              <u>The Library of Innerpeffray</u>
              <p>The Library and School at Innerpeffray were founded by David Drummond 3rd Lord Madertie in around 1680, the
                first free public lending library in Scotland. Madertie was a member of the Drummond Family, one of the most
                important landowning families of the area, friend and brother-in-law to James Graham, First Marquis of Montrose.</p>

              <p>The original library was "partly in the west end of the chapel of Innerpeffray and partly in that little new
                house lately built by me at the east end of the kirk yard. " Making books available to ordinary people free
                of charge was unprecedented. Madertie wished the library and school to benefit the community "in time coming"
                and leaving them with a legacy of 5000 Scottish Merks charged his successors with the responsibility.</p>

              <p>In 1739 Robert Hay Drummond inherited the Innerpeffray estate and responsibility for the Library and School.
                He raised the funds and commissioned architect Charles Freebairn to design and build a new Library building
                immediately adjacent to the Chapel. This handsome Georgian edifice still houses the library today </p>

              <p>By the nineteenth century the school buildings were 'dilapidated' and a new School and Schoolmasters house
                were completed in 1846. Pupils came from the surrounding farms and settlements and the school was still in
                operation until 1946.</p>

              <p>The Borrowers' Register is perhaps the Library's most valuable book, 
                a handwritten record all the local people to who came to choose a book, and take it home to read. 
                Today, families from all over the world find their ancestors in the Register, often in their own handwriting, 
                and can hold the books they borrowed.</p>
